= Introduction =


Solo Solis Product Import plugin allows you to import WooCommerce simple products. It is really simple.

= How does it work? =


The WooCommerce Product Import Plugin takes JSON URL as input. You must have a Solo Solis JSON URL with you. This will match each field of JSON Feed with field of particular product, even admin can map the fields manually also. It will check if product is already exist then it will sync only stock of that particular product.


There are 3 steps to complete the import process. 
Step 1 - Add JSON URL to import product.
Step 2 - Mapping the Fields of product with JSON fields
Step 3 - Set the Cron and show the number of products will be import. 

It will set a cron in Wordress to import the products. so you don't need to wait till product import. it will import the products in backend.
